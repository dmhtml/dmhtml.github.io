			<h3>Github</h3>
			<p>Hosting a website on Github is really easy, and free! One compromise you make with this is the domain name. By default your website will be on the github.io domain but with a little tweaking you can set up a custom domain name, but that will be at the price of the domain name. <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/"> Here</a> is how to do that per their documentation. I even put <a href="https://dmhtml.github.io/index.html">this</a> site on github!</p>

    <div class="options" id="Raspberry Pi" role="article">
			<h3>Raspberry Pi</h3>
			<p>A Raspberry Pi is a small and cheap computer you can set up reaonably easily to self-host your own website. <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/help/">Here</a> is some information on configuring a it to get started then there are numerous guides only to shaw you how to set up a simple webserver to start hosting your own web pages from home. You will have to be able to <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Set-Up-Port-Forwarding-on-a-Router">port forward</a> on your router as well. </p>
        <p>DNS for self hosting must be set up as well if you want to use a name to resolve your website. You can purchase a domain name like usual or you can also use free DNS services which will provide you with a subdomain from one of the domains that people have donated.<a href="http://freedns.afraid.org/">Afraid.org</a> is a great free DNS provider that I have used before to much success. You just have to remember to log in occasionally or they will free up your domain name to others!</p>

    <div class="options" id="godaddy" role="article">
			<h3>GoDaddy</h3>
			<p>GoDaddy is a one stop shop for all your hosting needs! They can provide you with a streamlined interface for setting up a website, email service and domain name all in one place.</p>
		</div>
    
    <div class="options" id="vultr" role="article">
			<h3>Vultr</h3>
			<p>Vultr is a VPS provider, which means you will do more work setting up your website. You will have to manage a webserver like with the Raspberry pi and remember to update everything! This freedom allows a power user to configure their website more and even configure services to run from their website outside the static pages.</p> But remember: <blockquote>"With great power comes great responsibilty".</blockquote>
