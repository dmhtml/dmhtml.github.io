		<div class="summary" role="article">
			<p>Hosting a website is very easy with many options available to a person looking to host their website.</p>
			<p>The pricing differs depending on the services you get and there are ways to even host your website for free!</p>

			<h3>What does a host do?</h3>
			<p>A webhost provides computing resources used in displaying your web pages to the internet.</p>
			<p>They will also provide you with a public IP address for your website and may even provide domain names.</p>
			<p>Some hosts may also provide easy design interfaces and web management panels to make it easy to change the content of your website. A more "hands-off" approach can be taken as well if the host deals with updating your website software to make things easier.</p>

			<h3>So Why Can't I host this Myself?</h3>
			<p>You can! However, there are many things to consider when going this route. For example most residential internet providers do not give you a static IP which could change and result in making your web pages not visible. There are ways around this with different <a href="dns.html">DNS</a> services. Another consideration is the reliability of your internet uptime. If your internet goes out during a snow storm no one can visit your page!</p>

		<div class="par2"  role="article">
			<h3>Considerations</h3>
			<p>There are many questions you have to ask yourself when choosing a host for your website. Is this a personal website or business? Does it vital for services and need to be available all the time? How much am I willing to pay monthly? Will I be hosting this for a short time or for as long as I can imagine?</p>
